Description
===========
Innumerable is a beautiful collection of abstract visualisations, and is a striking portfolio showcasing what ColdFlame Studios, as a group, is capable of. It is an exhibit of what we’ve learned over the years, particularly in the areas of media and mathematics. The end result: a collection of visualisations that is mesmerising and beautiful, and aimed to inspire interest in mathematics and information technology. 
The exhibition of these visualisations is a responsive website - constructed using modern web technologies allowing for efficient, and visually beautiful accessibility. 

Inspiration
===========

Conception
----------
Innumerable started as an a project through which we could take on new programming skills and widen our capabilities as a producer of digital and IT media. Producing useful graphical systems was the original aim - and as such Innumerable began as visualisations to help conceptualise mathematical concepts, as well as to inspire interest in mathematics and IT. Over time, as more and more of the project began to take shape, more visualisations were produced. Finally, as the project was in its intermediate stages, the opportunity to enter the project into YICTE arose, and as such, the entry was created and finalised. 

Purpose & Abstract
----------

Innumerable was conceived in our minds with one end goal - to inspire interest in maths in the minds of young people, and to show how the purity of maths can be applied on the digital landscape to produce visualisations that are both useful and striking. 
Innumerable was also conceived with the purpose of showing how maths is not boring, or hard, or unlikeable. Rather, it is to showcase how its everyday applications can result in artistic and accessible creations. 
However, the purpose of Innumerable is also to showcase everything that we, as a group, can do. It is a resume, showcasing our abilities and originality of style. From tasteful animation and visualisation to original digital art, music and other creative services, Innumerable is our curriculum vitae.
