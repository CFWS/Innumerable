The Golden Spiral was a challenging visualisation to produce. In order to create the spiral, it was necessary to make many translations to the curve function of the spiral itself. In this case, the translations were applied to the arc function in VB.Net. Challenges presented themselves in discerning which individual translation was needed for each segment of the curve, however in the end, what resulted was a beautiful looking spiral.
